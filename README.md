# SIMPLE COUNTER PROJECY (React useState Hook Project)

This project was developed using React, specifically utilizing the useState hook for state management.

# Project Overview

The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate the usage of the useState hook in React. The useState hook is a built-in hook in React that allows functional components to manage state without the need for class components.

# Installation

# Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the project directory: cd project-directory

Dependencies
This project has the following dependencies:

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
ReactDOM: A package that provides DOM-specific methods for React.
Other dependencies specified in the package.json file.
You can install these dependencies by running npm install.

# Usage
Once the project is running, you can access it by opening your browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000. The page will display a React component that demonstrates the usage of the useState hook.

#  How it Works
The useState hook allows functional components to have stateful logic. It returns a pair of values: the current state value and a function to update it. By calling this update function, React will re-render the component, reflecting the updated state.

In this project, the useState hook is used to create a counter. Clicking the "Increment" button will increase the counter value, while clicking the "Decrement" button will decrease it. The current value of the counter is displayed on the screen.
